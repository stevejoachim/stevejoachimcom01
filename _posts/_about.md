I'm a software engineering graduate student looking for opportunities in the NYC area.

I spent most of my twenties working as a mechanical engineer in defense electronics. I designed enclosures and PCB assemblies for rugged computers. Despite years of building things, which I did enjoy, I found myself constantly distracted by my ongoing fascination with software and computer science. So one day, as I was reluctantly browsing mechanical engineering graduate programs, I thought, "Why not give software a try?".

That was the beginning of a long journey. I started taking classes at Harvard Extension and eventually transferred into Georgia Tech's OMSCS. Unsurprisingly, getting a masters degree while working full time is tough...and slow. After a few years, I couldn't wait any longer and left my job to finish the program and pursue software engineering full time.

I waited for a while to take the plunge, and 2020 seemed as good a year as any (spoiler: it wasn't). After finishing the degree this Summer and taking some time to hike in New England, I'm ready and excited to begin a career in software engineering.

I took a wide range of project-based courses in AI/ML, security, systems, and databases, but these days I'm focusing on machine learning and web development. I'm most comfortable with Python, but I've worked with a lot of different languages including JavaScript, C, and Java.

I have a ton of experience building and shipping (physical) products and a ton of passion for building and shipping software. I've been taking the transition slowly, working on the degree and building my computer science knowledge from the ground up. Combining this with my prior experience on product development teams as a mechanical engineer, I think I can hit the ground running and help your team make things happen.
