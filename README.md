# A site I made to tell people about myself

This is a personal landing page and blog I made with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

It statically renders the blog posts from markdown files at build time using [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling. It's based on the [`blog-starter`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/blog-starter) from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

Check it out at [https://stevejoachim.com](https://stevejoachim.com). Read all the things and  get in touch if you think I could work at your company.
